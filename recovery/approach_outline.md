old -> new
the final spell

Shelter your dreams before they become victims of a judging society!

Every person who is a puppet of his Fate can cry victim-victim,

But, only a select few people -- the heroes of their own life, the masters and controllers of their own fate : the ones who have awakened their destiny and actively work towards it -- can truly inspire others with their inspiring story that makes the world a better place, while reducimg human sufferings, end wars or world hunger once and for all.

Loud should not be your microphone when crying injustice;
Loud should be your actions in the "Silence of people trying to justify their unjust actions"; for forgiveness is the way going forward towards a better tommorow.

"I left bits and pieces of my soul at the places where I left my dreams unfinished."

Ok man, but what stops you from continuing now,
chasing the skies you have lost?

promises and regrets are one thing,
but if you were the final Light Keeper, the final guardian of the final gate -- which everyone is, just as you are -- and you see your life's work being destroyed, by people who feel victimized,
can you sacrifice yourself for the future generations, or would you, just like everyone else, would like to keep stealing away from them by leaving for them a world where they have no reason to continue chasing their dreams?

The final lighthouse may burn one day...
But think not thus, of the pain you hide, nor of the demons you battle,
think only about leaving a legacy to the innocent children of the World.

Think thus that, "I will be burned by this fire",

But the "fire, will it Inspire?"
