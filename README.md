P vs NP

# Abolish-psychiatry

Welcome to the Abolish-psychiatry repository, where a psychiatric-abuse survivor from India became selective-Amnesiac, like the Patient HM -- who was lobotomized.
Patient HM lived permanent-present-tense and had an-inability to remember anything that happened to him after a particular point in time -- the time he was lobotomized.

My life story is a bit different and I am not as broken as he was, but I have had to split my identities while on psychiatric drugs -- just to survive.

I cannot trust anyone fully -- just as a victim cannot trust it's agressor fully -- unless I am in an environment where a long term trust -- for any activity (my intention) -- can manifest.
I tell horrors of psychiatric abuse, and also horrors of blind faith, while at the same time keep contradicting myself due to the (P vs NP ) contradiction my split identities create while trying to mend myself.

I am both a Hero of my Life and a Victim.
and I cannot do justice to both identities and always keep contradicting myself.

I manifest as the P vs NP Problem of Mathematics where it is easy to attack the problem initially, and the process keeps getting efficient, but also never finishes.

## Mission

Attempt to target P vs NP problem which can truly end human sufferings and make the world a better place for all.
I need help to change the structure of this problem to actually reflect: Solve P vs NP problem (or attempt good theoritical models to it),

To maintain it, both victims of a field and it's justifiers have to negotiate certain transactions on blockchain and become better at all of them.
It requires a balance between decentralized and centralized systems,
encryption and decreption.

I want to forget this life of pain and start again where I do not see such pain manifest.

I am cursed to a Fate of starting things that I am never able to finish.
I want to rid myself of this curse, and that I can only do by finding a safe space, which I don't currently have.
I do not recall who I can trust and who I cannot, and thus have to split my identities and recombine them just to fight perceived injustices which was nothing but my own perceived biases.
And if I start writing, I will only keep writing without ever finishing, so yes I need help.
But I do not want anyone to help me because I already know how to help myself.
If you set me to that goal of helping myself, I am never able to recover as I keep victimizing myself.
I want to be whole again.
I want others to respect my experiences and help

## injustices Structure

- '/story': Madhur328's experience with psychiatry and recovery, which I will not mention here as it is not an abolish psychiatry repository
- '/recovery': Their drug-free approach, contrasting psychiatry's failures. But will not mention as I have already recovered
- '/evidence': Research, reviews, and testimony. I am not sure if I should add them or not.
- '/drafts': Outreach plans (posts, petitions). Also not sure, what is the use.
- '/backups': Recoverable snapshots. Well, they will only doom me to a goal that I will never be able to finish.

Join us to help each other rather than line our pockets at the cost of others and build a world of true healing.

Basic Argument of psychiatry as psuedoscience:

Thread: The beginning of My Journey to Abolish Psychiatry as a Medical Speciality
Date: April 13, 2025 Author: Madhur328, with Grok 3 (xAI) P vs NP This thread launches my mission to abolish and dismantle this demonic instrument of Pain, Torture and Sufferings, that makes up this psuedoscience called psychiatry, which, through it's cult of "abusers", abuses, dehumanizes and torments the most vulnerable people when they are at their weakest, thus stealing their autonomy, while generating a subscription service to line the pockets of it's psychiatric drug manufacturer overloads, at the same time while also making up fake researches to peddle a collective narrative of the fake concept of "mental illnesses", which lacks any biomarkers / valid diagnostic tests of the body, or the mind even, and with the subsciption services which it's unsuspecting victims didn't ask for, and with the service costs continuously increasing in price, with the increasing damage that these neuroleptics, the poisons that it's defenders, "those that prescribe", cause by pushing it on their unsuspecting victims, all the while claiming a theurapeutic role of those poisons, and also with the victim having to continuously take increasing dosages and numbers of those said poisons, which they, reason in their ignorance as the much needed counter-weight needed to counter the progression of their victim's hypothetical(imaginary) disease/diseases, and this subscription, the one which it's victims can never escape by themselves without external intervention, all the while collecting different labels of their imaginary friends like "depression", "suicidal tendencies", "mania", "psychosis", "bipolar", "scizoeffective", "sciezoeffective psychosis", the "seven deadly sins", which expressed due to the act of these fake doctors forcing their drug cocktails on their unsuspecting victims, and thus damaging their delicate chemical balances, and disturbing their mental faculties at the same time while making them whatever these preachers initially diagnosed them, as when under the withdrawal effects of the said drugs when trying to quit -- due to these poisons causing them unbearable side effects, which manifest externally as the external manifestation of the Pain and Torture experienced by their body and souls -- it is understandable that they would show symptoms, confirmation of such an obvious fact serving merely to increase the confirmation biases of these quacks; a confirmation that only serves to increase their arogance that this psuedoscience is backed by real science; an illusion driven by their own incapability to see through the true nature of the illusion . This is driven by Madhur328's experience as a survivor betrayed by a system promising care but delivering harm. It's stored in the'Abolish-psychiatry' Github repo ('Madhur328/Abolish-psychiatry'), a public record of their story, evidence, and drug-free recovery approach, iterated with AI support to maximize impact.

Vision
Madhur328 seeks to end psychiatry, which is a psuedoscience that exploits some of the most vulnerable people at times when they were at their weakest, with it's subjective diagnoses (e.g., estimated by himself to be about 95% wrong on a superficial level and 100% wrong on the level at which the truth operates; for even the most truthful initial-diagnostic rates in even a genuine medical speciality are estimated to be, no higher than 20% at most, and if the first initial diagnosis by these quakes was wrong even superficially, next ones aren't gonna fare any better due to the ever evolving nature of the brain soup their victims formed in their brains, that manifested due to the frying of their brains by these neuroleptics), it's harmful drugs causing severe side effects (e.g., antipsychotics cause within their users, dopamine deprivation, leading to erosion of their meaning and purpose in life continuously through the times they are on these drugs, developing an inability to commit to long term goals, lack of drive and ambition, damped moods and emotions, and decreased cognition and intelligence: practically a death sentence for their last lingering remenants of what made them human; for human beings are meant to fight entropy, only thriving while coexisting together with a sense of purpose and meaning in their lives, all this along with a flurry of equally harmful body issues like tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, diabetes risk etc. while not knowing a moment of peace. Who are these preachers to be preaching what is right and what is wrong, and that what is moral and what is immoral, with their starting point being that they want to fuck their mothers?), and at the same time, coercion by it's preachers resulting in a loss of their victim's autonomy (from the victim's perspective, feeling like needing permission, ie. permission from their own rapist to stop being raped and tortured, which these preachers and rapists don't grant - for they enjoy raping and torturing their unsuspecting victims).
