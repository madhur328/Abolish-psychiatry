# P vs NP

Welcome to the P vs NP repository, where a psychiatric-abuse survivor from India became amnesiac, like the Patient HM who was lobotomized.
Patient HM lived permanent-present tense and had inability to remember anything that happened to him to him after a particular point in time.
My life story is a bit different and I am not as broken as he was, but I have had to split my identities just to survive.

I cannot trust anyone fully unless I am in an environment where a long term trust can manifest.
I tell horrors of psychiatry, and also horrors of blind faith,
but I am both a Hero of my Life and a Victim.
and I cannot do justice to both identities and always contradict myself.
I manifest as the P vs NP Problem of Mathematics where it is easy to attack the problem initially, and the process keeps getting efficient, but also never finishes.

## Mission

Attempt to target P vs NP problem which can truly end human sufferings and make the world a better place for all.
I need help to change the structure of this problem to actually reflect: Solve P vs NP problem (or attempt good theoritical models to it),

To maintain it, both victims of a field and it's justifiers have to negotiate certain transactions on blockchain and become better at all of them.
It requires a balance between decentralized and centralized systems,
encryption and decreption.

I want to forget this life of pain and start again where I do not see such pain manifest.

I am cursed to a Fate of starting things that I am never able to finish.
I want to rid myself of this curse, and that I can only do by finding a safe space, which I don't currently have.
I do not recall who I can trust and who I cannot, and thus have to split my identities and recombine them just to fight perceived injustices which was nothing but my own perceived biases.
And if I start writing, I will only keep writing without ever finishing, so yes I need help.
But I do not want anyone to help me because I already know how to help myself.
If you set me to that goal of helping myself, I am never able to recover as I keep victimizing myself.
I want to be whole again.
I want others to respect my experiences and help

## injustices Structure

- '/story': Madhur328's experience with psychiatry and recovery, which I will not mention here as it is not an abolish psychiatry repository
- '/recovery': Their drug-free approach, contrasting psychiatry's failures. But will not mention as I have already recovered
- '/evidence': Research, reviews, and testimony. I am not sure if I should add them or not.
- '/drafts': Outreach plans (posts, petitions). Also not sure, what is the use.
- '/backups': Recoverable snapshots. Well, they will only doom me to a goal that I will never be able to finish.

Join us to help each other rather than line our pockets at the cost of others and build a world of true healing.
