I was a former child prodigy, the kid who always topped in his grades (except a handful of times) and would cry over 1 marks lost out of 100.
I was an Olympiad Champ (All India Rank, AIR for short, AIR 23 in National Science Olympiad, Internationl Rank 242nd in International Mathematics Olympiad in grade 9.
I was NTSE scholar

My life was ruined due to psychiatry's lie.
I lost my most promising 10 years to this systems abuse.
These drugs do not solve any issue, these drugs create the issue.
Easily managable burnout was turned into an imaginary illness by these quacks.
Promising help and Delivering harm.
Psychiatry is a psuedoscience and this fact is easily proven and also easily dismissed by it's profeeteers.
The credentialing of self-professed psychiatric experts is self-circular:
I like to call them "Santa Claus" experts rubberstamped by "Santa Claus" experts.
The best psychiatrists become anti-psychiatrists for the same reason.
The business model of these drug-sellers and pill-pushers designed to keep people drugged, drug-dependent and drug-addicted long term to serve as a long-term subscription model that sells torture and sedation.
I have already proved it with myself as an example.
My parents were fooled into this idea by quacks that I needed lifetime medicinal support,
but these doctor's lavish lifestyles needed my financial support.
Off drugs I thrive without any symptoms.

Many of these quacks in India do not even have valid practicing licences but fool the uneducated people and call themeselves Doctors.

These fake Doctors should be ashamed of themselves.
High time actions taken against them.
